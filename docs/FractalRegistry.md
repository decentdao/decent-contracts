# Solidity API

## FractalRegistry

Implementation of [IFractalRegistry](./interfaces/IFractalRegistry.md).

### FractalNameUpdated

```solidity
event FractalNameUpdated(address daoAddress, string daoName)
```

### FractalSubDAODeclared

```solidity
event FractalSubDAODeclared(address parentDAOAddress, address subDAOAddress)
```

### updateDAOName

```solidity
function updateDAOName(string _name) external
```

Updates a DAO's registered "name". This is a simple string
with no restrictions or validation for uniqueness.

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type   | Description  |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| \_name | string | new DAO name |

### declareSubDAO

```solidity
function declareSubDAO(address _subDAOAddress) external
```

Declares an address as a subDAO of the caller's address.

This declaration has no binding logic, and serves only
to allow us to find the list of "potential" subDAOs of any
given Safe address.

Given the list of declaring events, we can then check each
Safe still has a [FractalModule](../FractalModule.md) attached.

If no FractalModule is attached, we'll exclude it from the
DAO hierarchy.

In the case of a Safe attaching a FractalModule without calling
to declare it, we would unfortunately not know to display it
as a subDAO.

#### Parameters

| Name            | Type    | Description                                               |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_subDAOAddress | address | address of the subDAO to declare as a child of the caller |
