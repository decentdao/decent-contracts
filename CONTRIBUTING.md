# Contributing to Fractal

As an open-source, community driven project, we want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible. This could include:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or environment variables, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/fractal-framework/fractal/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fractal-framework/fractal/issues)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
